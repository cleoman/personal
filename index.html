                Hello, and welcome to my personal website. This website has been lovingly crafted by hand. By choice, I'm building everything from the ground up, even when that's a bad idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                Long term, my plan is to use this website as a playground. I won't keep it this simple, but the plan is to build <em>everything</em> by hand as a learning exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm an early career software engineer currently working remotely at <a href="http://aerostr.at">Aerostrat</a>. 
                Before that, I worked at <a href="http://alarm.com">Alarm.com</a> in McLean, VA. 
                I have a BS in Computer Science from George Mason University. I spent a total of seven years in the United States Army, some in the reserves and some in active duty.
