# WTF is this?
This is a personal site doing stuff in a completely oddball way for fun. There's no frontend framework, just a lot of obtuse and by-hand coding.

# Run Development Server
For now, I like using the npm package `live-server` that hosts a really simple development server.

```bash
npm install -g live-server
live-server
```
