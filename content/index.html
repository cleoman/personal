        Hello, and welcome to my personal website. This website has been lovingly crafted by hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        Long term, my plan is to use this website as a playground. I won't keep it this simple, but the plan is to build <em>everything</em> by hand as a learning exercise.

        I'm an early career software engineer currently working remotely at <a href="http://aerostr.at">Aerostrat</a>. 
        Before that, I worked at <a href="http://alarm.com">Alarm.com</a> in McLean, VA. 
        I have a BS in Computer Science from George Mason University. I spent a total of seven years in the United States Army, some in the reserves and some in active duty.
